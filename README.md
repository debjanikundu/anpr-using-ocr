automatic numberplate recognition using ai system
The Advanced End-to-End AI Number Plate Recognition System is a complex yet powerful 
solution that combines data acquisition, AI model integration, and real-time UI to accurately 
detect and extract text from car number plates. This workflow procedure outlines the 
systematic development and deployment of this cutting-edge technology, ensuring its 
effectiveness and reliability in various applications.

FUTURE PROSPECTS: -
Real-Time User Interface (UI) Integration –
⮚ UI Development: A user-friendly real-time UI is designed and developed to showcase 
the system's functionality. The UI should be intuitive, allowing users to interact with 
the system seamlessly.
⮚ Integration of Detection and Extraction Models: The trained object detection and text 
extraction models are integrated into the UI, forming the core of the number plate 
recognition system.
⮚ Real-Time Processing: As images or video streams are fed into the system through 
the UI, the object detection model identifies car number plates, and the text extraction 
model transcribes the plate numbers in real-time.
⮚ Display and Output: The recognized number plate information is displayed within the 
UI, providing users with instant access to the identified plate numbers.
